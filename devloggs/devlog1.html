				<p>Welcome to the first ever devlog of IR:QFTR</p>

				<p>Chapter 1 will be the main focus of this devlog.</p>

				<p>There's not many art assets done yet. Nor any assets for it yet. But we have the base engine almost done. I still need to code a few more things before I can say it's complete.</p>

				<p>I still also have to make the pre-story as well.</p>

				<p>Asides from that other chapters have been conceptualized but I cannot share the ideas I have yet.</p>

				<p>The main menu has been conceptualized as well that I can indeed share.</p>

				<p>This will take a little bit of time till it's coded in but I decided it's enough to share a concept of it.</p>

				<p>As much as I wish I could show main images of the game so far there's no assets and it looks really bland without them so you'll have to wait.<br>
